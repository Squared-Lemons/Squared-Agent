# Feedback Archive

Processed feedback files are archived here after implementation.

Each file represents learnings that have been reviewed and either:
- Implemented as improvements to templates, commands, or knowledge
- Noted for future consideration in `suggestions/`

Keeping archived feedback provides a historical record of how the agent has evolved based on real-world usage.
