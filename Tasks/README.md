# Tasks

Task documentation files that can be included in setup packages.

Tasks are one-time setup activities that get executed after the base setup and commands are configured.

## Adding Tasks

Create a markdown file describing the task:
- What needs to be done
- Step-by-step instructions
- Verification criteria

The `/prepare-setup` command will list these files as options.
