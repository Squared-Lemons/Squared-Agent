  ### Knowledge Gaps
  - Better Auth Organizations plugin documentation could include more
    examples of linking organizations to custom business tables
  - QR code generation patterns for member check-in systems would be
    useful to document

  ### Setup Issues
  - SQLite native module handling in Next.js should be pre-configured
    in the template
  - Environment variable structure with symlinks could be documented better

  ### New Patterns
  - Multi-tenant SaaS with Better Auth Organizations + custom business tables
  - Monorepo structure with shared UI, database, and auth packages
  - Server actions pattern for CRUD operations in Next.js 15

  ### Technical Gotchas
  - Better Auth requires **singular** table names (user, session, member)
  - `better-sqlite3` needs webpack externals configuration in Next.js
  - DATABASE_URL must be relative path from app directory with symlinked .env
