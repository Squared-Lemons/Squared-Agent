# Suggestions

My proposals for improving this agent, organized by category.

## Categories

- **skills/** - Proposed new skill guides
- **commands/** - Proposed command improvements
- **workflow/** - Proposed workflow changes
- **other/** - Miscellaneous improvements

## How This Works

1. I review `inbox/` and `LEARNINGS.md`
2. When I notice patterns or opportunities, I create suggestions here
3. Each suggestion is a markdown file explaining:
   - What to change
   - Why it helps
   - Implementation approach
4. We discuss and prioritize together
5. Approved suggestions get implemented
