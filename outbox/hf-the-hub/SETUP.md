## Setup Instructions

### 1. Initialize the project

```bash
pnpm install    # or npm install
```

### 2. Create CLAUDE.md

Create a `CLAUDE.md` in the project root describing your project, commands, and conventions. Use the knowledge guides as reference for your stack.

### 3. Install Recommended Skills

Based on your knowledge categories, install these skills:

**Auth:**
```bash
npx skills add better-auth/skills
```

**Web:**
```bash
npx skills add anthropics/skills -s frontend-design
npx skills add anthropics/skills -s webapp-testing
npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills
```

**Monorepo:**
```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/vercel/turborepo --skill turborepo
```

**Patterns (optional):**
```bash
npx skills add anthropics/skills -s mcp-builder
npx skills add anthropics/skills -s docx
npx skills add anthropics/skills -s pptx
npx skills add anthropics/skills -s xlsx
npx skills add anthropics/skills -s pdf
```

### 4. Run the Investigate Task (if existing codebase)

If this is an existing project, tell Claude:
"Read ExistingProject-Investigate.md and execute the investigation task."

### 5. Start Working

```bash
claude .
```

Then use `/start-session` to begin.

## Workflow

```
/start-session → /new-feature → work → /commit → /complete-feature → /end-session
```

This project can spawn its own children via `/spawn-project` (pass-through mode).
