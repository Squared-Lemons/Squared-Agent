# How to Use Squared Agent

A quick reference for getting started.

---

## What This Agent Does

Squared Agent bootstraps new projects with Claude Code. You describe what you want to build, and it creates a setup package with instructions, knowledge, and workflows that another Claude Code instance uses to build your project.

**Think of it as:** A senior developer who packages up everything a junior developer needs to build your app.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Open with Claude Code:** `claude .`
2. **Start a session:** `/start-session`
3. **Create something:** `/spawn-project` (for new projects) or `/new-feature` (to work on this repo)
